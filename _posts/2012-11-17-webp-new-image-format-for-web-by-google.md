I haven't performed a scientific analysis :D

But, based on sample images...

I must confess, that, i'm overall high surprised at how well **WebP** preserves image quality and keeps file size small.

This post is only about thinking in WebP to, possibly, replace JPEG. At less, as a trial. I will take the risk xD.




> [1] The format was first announced in 2010 and is supposed to be a new open standard for lossily compressed true-color graphics on the web, thereby being presented as a direct competitor to the older JPEG scheme, to which it is meant to compare favorably with the production of smaller files for comparable image quality.




> [2] WebP is a new image format that provides lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller in size compared to JPEG images at equivalent SSIM index. WebP supports lossless transparency (also known as alpha channel) with just 22% additional bytes. Transparency is also supported with lossy compression and typically provides 3x smaller file sizes compared to PNG when lossy compression is acceptable for the red/green/blue color channels.

Seems great right ?

But as every new thing, we need codecs, so, for watching WebP Images, our browser must support it.

What about some samples?

**JPEG sample - 1024 x 752 -120.78 Kb**

**WebP sample - 1024 x 742 - 80.76 Kb**

**JPEG sample - 2592 x 1944 - 972 Kb**

**WebP sample - 2592x 1944 - 280 Kb**

Nice right ?
