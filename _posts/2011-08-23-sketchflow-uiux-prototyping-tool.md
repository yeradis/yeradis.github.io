**SketchFlow** UI UX Prototyping Tool lets you:

* _rapidly turn your ideas into effective prototypes_
* _engage clients early in the design process_
* _enable effective client review and feedback_
* _take your ideas from concept to finished project_

**SketchFlow**, a feature of _Expression Studio Ultimate_ , revolutionizes how quickly and efficiently you can demonstrate your vision for an application. It provides an informal and quick way to explore, iterate and prototype user interface scenarios, allowing you to evolve your concepts from a series of rough ideas into a living and breathing prototype that can be made as real as a particular client or project demands. This rapid, iterative and cost effective approach to user interface prototyping allows you to concentrate on what matters most, being creative and building the best solution for your client, on time and within budget.


The mission of the _Expression _team is to help designers to create great user experiences and SketchFlow is a new set of tools for _Expression **Blend**_ to create sketches and prototypes of interactive content and applications, giving Blend a new role in pre-production and design phases of the development process.
