Concept: **Learn by doing**

It appears that many developers are very comfortable with the reading portion of learning, but  stay there too long and never get around to creating something.

This seems to be common for a lot of people, who obtain a wealth of "lecture" experience but very little time spent doing something with that knowledge.

When you try to figure out why, you usually get the excuse: No time!

Don't be a dick! The only way to prove and confirm that your knowledge works is doing something with it, by doing is the only way to check all that knowledge is not wrong.

We need to do something with that knowledge even if what we build is entirely useless(probably) to the world, our creation has a value, because remember : ** Practice makes the master!** "));
