If you dont know that a goal is a general statement about a desired outcome with one or more specific objectives that define in precise terms what is to be accomplished within a designated time frame and may be performance-related, developmental, a special project, or some combination all mentioned and that should should describe accomplishments, not activities.

Then you are stupid, and that´s why we are reading this peace of shit that i call a blog post xD

And if you continue reading this, is because you want to be SMART rather than stupid. (Me too)

So now, after I've insulted you, you should know that SMART, is an acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives.

The concept of writing SMART goals is very important for accomplishing individual objetives. It is also very important for ensuring good communication between peers, even between staff members and managers in order to share the same understanding and clarity of goals. (And now i´m just remembering my current job in the real life xD )

Each letter in SMART refers to a different criterion for judging objectives.

A SMART goal is defined as one that is specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and time-bound.

So let's take those letters individually.

## Specific
Goals must be written in a very simple way to avoid confusion and must define what you are going to do, you should address the five Ws… who, what, when, where, witch, why and how.

* What: What do I want to accomplish with this goal?
* Why: Specific reasons, purpose or benefits of accomplishing the goal.
* Who: Who is involved?
* Where: Identify a location.
* Which: Identify requirements and constraints.
* How: Now with Ws... answered: How do i want to accomplish it?

Make sure the goal specifies what needs to be done with a timeframe for completion.

## Measurable
Goals should be measurable so you get tangible evidence that you have accomplished the task. You should include numeric or descriptive measures that define the quantity, quality, the cost, or any concrete criteria for measuring progress toward the accomplishment of the goal. You need concrete criteria to measure the goal, because without measure there is no way to know whether you are making a positive progress toward successful completion of the goal.

## Achievable
Goals should be achievable, shoul be realistic and attainable; they should stretch you slightly so you feel challenged, but defined well enough so that you can achieve them. You must possess the appropriate knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to achieve the goal, also, the goal objetives should be within your control and influence. If a goal is impossible to achieve, do not try to accomplish it. Achievable goals motivate. Impossible goals de- motivate them.

So, ask this yourself:

* Can i achieve the goal with the available resources?
* Can i achieve the goal in the timeframe originally outlined?
* Consider authority or control, influence, resources, and work environment support to meet the goal.

## Results-focused
Goals should measure outcomes, not activities.

Once again, ask this yourself:

* Why is the goal important?
* How will the goal help to achieve the objetives?
* What is the reason, purpose, or benefit of accomplishing the goal?
* What is the result of the goal?

## Time-bound
Goal objectives should identify a definite target date for completion and/or frequencies for specific action steps that are important for achieving the goal, that timeframe should create a practical sense of urgency, or results in tension between the current reality and the vision of the goal, but in a healty way of course. Because we all know that without such tension the goal is not going to produce a relevante outcome xD



And that's what mean to be SMART xD

Now i just need to remember the SMART acronym when establishing goals and objetives.
