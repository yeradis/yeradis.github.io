**Your code is STUPID!**
My code is **STUPID**!

Almost all of the code around the world is **STUPID**!

And if you get offended, is a good thing.

I know nobody likes to hear their code is **STUPID**. Me neither!

But you have to swallow your pride.

Dont get me wrong, iÂ´m saying that your code is **STUPID**, not you!

How to detect if your code is **STUPID**?

What characterizes **STUPID **code? What makes code **STUPID**?

[**STUPID**][1]

**S** ingleton
**T** ight coupling
**U** ntestability
**P** remature Optimization
**I** ndescriptive Naming
**D** uplication

If you can find those patterns in your code, then your code is **STUPID**.

How to make your code don't be **STUPID**?

To achieve this, what you need is a **SOLID** **GRASP**!

Yes! **SOLID ** and **GRASP**

A collection of Object-oriented design principles for "good code".

[**SOLID**][2]

**S** ingle responsibility principle
**O** pen/closed principle
**L** iskov substitution principle
**I** nterface segregation principle
**D** ependency inversion principle

[**GRASP**][3]

**G** eneral
**R** esponsibility
**A** ssignment
**S** oftware
**P** atterns (or Principles)

The different patterns and principles used in GRASP are: Controller, Creator, Indirection, Information Expert, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, Polymorphism, Protected Variations, and Pure Fabrication.

With that information, its time for SMART coding!
